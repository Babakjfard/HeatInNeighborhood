models are trained and evaluated and are resampled. Here the results are compared
```{r}
load("trained_models_I.rda")
summary(results)

```

and visual comparison:
```{r}
dotplot(results)
```

I have added one ensemble model now (Random Forest). I am going to consider and research about other ensemble models such as XGBoost later.

```{r}
load("models_I_withensembles.rda")
summary(results_with_ensembles)

```
```{r}
dotplot(results_with_ensembles)
```
